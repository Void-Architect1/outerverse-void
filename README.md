# Outerverse (Void) – Official Repository

This repository preserves all canonical structures, laws, tiers, concepts, and the metaphysical architecture of **Outerverse (Void)**.

## What Is the Outerverse (Void)?
A fully structured multi-layered cosmological framework built on:
- Logic
- Mathematics

It is not a “stronger fictional verse”—it is a **true meta-structure** explaining why fiction cannot surpass higher layers of existence.
